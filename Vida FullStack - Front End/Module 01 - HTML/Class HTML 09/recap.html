            everything in all the classes, but I will make this page using the knowledge of them.<br>

        <h2>Here's a Little Recap of the Classes</h2>
        <p>The pages may not have much added to them, but they were essential to learning the basics.</p>

        <article>
            <h3>Classes 00 to 03</h3>
            <p>These are the more simple classes</p>
            <section>
                <h4>Class 00 - Intro to HTML</h4>
                <p>In the introductory class, I learned the basic Structure of an HTML page, including the html, head
                    and body tags. <br>Also, inside the head tag, I added the meta charset and title properties, here's
                    a link to <a href="../class HTML 00/Study.html">visit the page</a></p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h4>Class 01 - Headers, Paragraphs and Line Breaks</h4>
                <p>In Class 01, I learned about Headers with the h1 to h6 tags, paragraphs and all about line breaks.
                    <br>Here's the link to <a href="../class HTML 01/hspsandbrs.html">visit the page</a>
                </p>
            </section>
            <h4>Class 02 - Navigation</h4>
            <section>Yhe second class is where I learned to use the navigation bar, demonstrated in the header of
                this page.<br>
                <a href="../class HTML 02/nav.html">Visit the page</a>.
            </section>
            <section>
                <h4>Class 03 - Images</h4>
                <p>Here I learned to insert images and add links and descriptions to them:<br><br>
                    <a href="../class HTML 03/images.html">
                        <img src="Screenshot 2024-08-21 114711.png" alt="Borderlands 4 Steam Page" />

        </article>
        <article>
            <h3>Classes 04 to 08</h3>
            <p>These are the more difficult classes, with one exception</p>
            <section>
                <h4>Class 04 - Tables</h4>
                <p>In this class I've learned about tables, as demonstrated earlier in the page</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h4>Class 05 - ID and Classes</h4>
                <p>This class was about the ID and Classes section of code, which didn't have much use so far, but
                    should be very relevant when working with CSS and JS<br>
                    Although almost empty, here's the <a href="../class HTML 05/idandclass.html">link</a> to the page
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h4>Class 06 - Forms</h4>
                <p>This is the biggest class of the course so far, as the subject has many variations and applications.
                    It is one of my favourite classes, but it is a bit complex, I need many more examples and also real
                    applications to tuly understand it and learn all the more commonly used tags.<br>
                    I've used the knowledge to do a fake form on the top and bottom of this page, just to illustrate a
                    bit:</p>
                <form>
                    <input type="radio" name="agree" value="1">Understood
                    <input type="radio" name="agree" value="0">I didn't see it!<br>
                    <button><a href="../class HTML 06/forms.html">Go to Class Page</a></button>
                </form>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h4>Class 07 - Structural Tags</h4>
                <p>This is the exception in difficulty, as it only contains the structural tags that are, in most part,
                    simple. I've used them all along the page, and the last one (the aside tag) I'll use a little
                    incorrectly, as there is no CSS styling so far.<br>
                    Here's a <a href="../class HTML 07/structuraltags.html">link</a> to the class page where I had a
                    lot
                    of fun testing the tags.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h4>Class 08 - Divs</h4>
                <p>In the final class, I got a quick introduction to the div tag, albeit it was very simple, as it will
                    have more use when I can add CSS and JS to the formula. So far, it's a bit confusing, as there are
                    no practical examples that I can use so far.<br>
                    There's <a href="../class HTML 08/div.html">the link to the page</a>, albeit it is very empty
                    as divs do not have an inherited style or function without CSS or JS.</p>
