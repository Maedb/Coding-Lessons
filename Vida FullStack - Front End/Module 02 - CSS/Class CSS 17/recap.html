            <p> This is the recap for the CSS Module of the course. Since this module has many classes,
                instead of going one for one, I will try to make the recap with a bit of the knowledge of each. Also, I
                will include a bit of extra researched stylings.</p>

            <section>
                <h2 class="title2">Main Scenario Quest (Objectives of this Recap)</h2>
                <p class="objectives">
                    1. Make a visually pleasing page;<br>
                    2. Stick to a consistant theme accross the whole page;<br>
                    3. Provide minimal usability to the page;<br>
                    4. Use a little bit of knowledge of each of the 17 classes to make the page; <br>
                    5. Use external resources to apply extra stylings to the page; <br>
                    6. Don't overdo and leave the code as clean as possible;<br>
                    7. At last, but more important, have plenty of fun exploring ideas and possibilities.

                <article>
                    <h2 class="title2">State of the Realm (Overview of the Module)</h2>
                    <p>Starting this review/overview of the module, it has to be said that it is a long module, spanning
                        hours of content to work with. Most of the classes are straightforward and simple, though I take
                        my time as I want to properly document everything on my personal <a class="plink"
                            href="https://www.notion.so/CSS-Vida-FullStack-387f8c516cec49dcb7b9fb094963ed6e?pvs=4">Notion
                            Page</a>. I took around 25 days to complete the class, with the entire annotation system and
                        some delays.
                    </p>
                    <p>Reviewing a bit class by class:<br>
                        <span class="pclass">> Class 01</span> served as an introduction to CSS, bringing the basics of
                        the style tag.<br>
                        <span class="pclass">> Class 02</span> was about the differences of External CSS, Internal CSS
                        and Inline CSS. In this code, I tried to keep most of the CSS on an external style.css file, but
                        to use a bit of the knowledge, I did an inline application. <br>
                        <span class="pclass">> Class 03</span> explained the selectors, being them the tags, classes or
                        IDs.<br>
                        <span class="pclass">> Class 04</span> was about specificity, albeit a bit abstract right now,
                        it seemed simple to understand. It's somewhat strange to think about it. I believe it is very
                        present in this code, but I still need to work with more complex situations to properly get a
                        grasp on it.<br>
                        <span class="pclass">> Class 05</span> was about Inheritance, much more straightforward concept
                        and widely used here.<br>
                        <span class="pclass">> Class 06</span>. Colours. Not much to say here. Albeit a very simple
                        concept, there are many different ways to use it. In the class, we also took a look at some
                        online colour palette websites.<br>
                        <span class="pclass">> Class 07</span> went over different measuring units to use on styling. I
                        think it is a very straight forward lesson and pretty simple to understand. Using it in this
                        practice has been a bit sloppy, but still manageable.<br>
                        <span class="pclass">> Class 08</span> was super simple, about margins, paddings and borders in
                        general. Very important concepts.<br>
                        <span class="pclass">> Class 09</span> was simple yet complicated to apply. It went over display
                        visibility, but trying to use it in this webpage proved to be quite complicated and unstable. I
                        need to train much more on this.<br>
                        <span class="pclass">> Class 10</span> on positioning was simple, but using it together with
                        Display Visibility in this page did quite a number on me.<br>
                        <span class="pclass">> Class 11</span> about border radius was as specific as you can be. It was
                        fun, and I can see much of the use here. Also in this class as a little extra, we played a bit
                        with the :hover selector property, very interesting.<br>
                        <span class="pclass">> Class 12</span> on backgrounds, simple, but efficient. Also I had some
                        problems doing the background here, but at the end of the day, they were more related to the
                        image I chose to add here than the proper application. I learned a lot of strategies for
                        background doing this recap.<br>
                        <span class="pclass">> Class 13</span> added gradients to the background, and allowed me to add
                        a bit more flair to the pages. I used a lot of it here.<br>
                        <span class="pclass">> Class 14</span>. Fonts. I love fonts. I loved learning to add fonts to
                        the page. The only thing we didn't go over was how to add completely custom fonts that are not
                        on Google Fonts, but I'm sure I'll go over it someday.<br>
                        <span class="pclass">> Class 15</span> was about the applications and transformations of Text.
                        Simple and powerful. I used a lot of it, specially on the links.<br>
                        <span class="pclass">> Class 16</span>, nearing the end, was over shadows. Although very cool, I
                        think it's something that needs to be used with caution, to not be overdone.<br>
                        <span class="pclass">> Class 17</span> was the final class, about making a responsive design for
                        different screen sizes. Very important nowadays. I'm adding this last on the CSS of this page, I
                        don't know if this is the proper protocol or if I should've been doing it as I went. It didn't
                        really work out in this page, but it is something that I'll keep my mind to the next time.<br>
                        <span class="pclass">> Class 18</span> is this recap finally. Not an official class, but
                        something I like to make to test what I learned. I did it with the HTML module and I'll keep
                        doing it when it's relevant.

                    <h2 class="title2">Inner Voice (Review of the Module/Course)</h2>
                    <p>Although I've only been through 3 modules - Intro to Git/setup, HTML and CSS - I feel I already
                        learned a lot, it already felt amazing in the last recap doing the mockup webpage, this one
                        takes the cake, being my favourite module so far.</p>
                    <p>It just feels amazing to style and make a webpage that looks cool. Of course the page right now
                        is far far away from being an actual page, or a properly designed one, but it's the early stages
                        of it, and it feels exciting. I can't wait for the next steps.</p>
